<h2>Chat with Channel</h2>
<p>An open source project which makes it easy for non-technical people to create a custom chatbot for any YouTube channel by creating vector embeddings for all of the transcripts from the channel's videos</p>

<p>This project allows anyone to download the transcripts from a YouTube channel (or group of channels), create vector embeddings and then chat with them in a user interface similar to ChatGPT!</p>
<p>It's friendly for less technical users because it only requires that you enter a few settings, and the program takes care of the rest.</p>
