<h2>TypeScript Type Fixing Agent</h2>
<p>An open source AI agent which automates fixing type errors in large 100,000+ line TypeScript code bases.</p>

<p>Types are like labels that describe what kind of data you can work with in a programming language and type errors are like mislabelled data. Type errors often indicate the existence of a bug, and while they are easy to identify, they often require complex chains of reasoning to solve.</p>
<p>My type fixing agent solves this problem by autonomously fixing type errors while you sleep!</p>
<h3>Main Challenges</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>High Quality Context:</strong> I learned the compiler API for the TypeScript programming language to provide precise context to the LLM agent and improve its multi-step reasoning performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> Crafting prompts to maximize GPT's multi-step reasoning ability.</li>
</ul>
