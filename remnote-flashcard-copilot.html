<p>The tool not only eases onboarding for new users by providing expert feedback, but it also serves as an educational scaffold for more seasoned students, encouraging self-improvement in flashcard creation rather than dependence on AI-generated content.</p>

<h3>Main Challenges:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Backend:</strong> I built RemNote's LLM request backend used across all RemNote's AI projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimizing Latency:</strong> I implemented <a href="https://twitter.com/experilearning/status/1700122711555801315">partial JSON parsing</a> to stream GPT function call results to the user as they are generated.</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> Crafting prompts that cater to a global user base, accommodating multiple languages.</li>
  <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> I built extensive prompt evaluation suites to ensure high quality completions.</li>
</ul>
